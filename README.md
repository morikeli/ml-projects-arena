# Machine learning projects arena

## Overview
This repo contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have developed after learning ML algorithms using `scikit-learn` library.

### Instructions
You can view the projects using a browser or a text editor, e.g. VS Code.

- Installation instructions
  1. Clone the repo to your desktop
  2. If you are using Windows, download Python interpreter from [Python's official website](https://python.org) and install the interpreter.
  3. Open the folder using a text editor and open terminal in your text editor. You can also open the folder in terminal/CMD.
  4. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
     ```
     python -m venv .venv
     ```

     OR
     
     ```
     python3 -m venv .venv
     ```
     where .venv is the virtual environment folder.

  5. Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

     ``` (Windows CMD)
         .venv\Scrips\activate
     ```
     
     ``` (Linux/Mac)
         source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

  6. Install required Python modules using pip and use the following command:

     ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

  7. Use the command to open the entire folder in your default browser using Jupyter.

     Type ``` jupyter notebook``` in your terminal/CMD and press ```Enter```.

  8. A new tab will be opened in your default browser. Select a folder and click a `.ipynb` file to view the notebook.
